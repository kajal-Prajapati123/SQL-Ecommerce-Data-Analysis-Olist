# SQL E-Commerce Data Analysis Project â€“ Olist

This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship task where I performed SQL-based data analysis on a real-world E-commerce dataset (Olist) using MySQL.

## Key Insights

### Top Selling Products

We created a view to identify best-selling products based on quantity and revenue.

```sql
CREATE VIEW top_selling_products_view AS
SELECT 
    p.product_category_name,
    oi.product_id,
    COUNT(*) AS total_sold,
    SUM(oi.price) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    order_items oi
JOIN 
    products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 
    oi.product_id, p.product_category_name
ORDER BY 
    total_sold DESC;
